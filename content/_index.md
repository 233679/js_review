# Welcome!

Today we are going to be discussing why javascript is a terrible, terrible language & should never be used.  
  
Firstly, take a look at, well... I don't even know what to say about it. It's just terrible...  
It's with great regret that i inform you to see [*this*]({{% relref "/reason_uno" %}}).

Now you've seen that monstrocity, get ready for another heap of *why* with javascripts [truthy & falsey table]({{% relref "/truthy-falsey" %}})!

You expect consistend behvaiour, [yes?]({{% relref "/object_is" %}})

[Logic?]({{% relref "/equality" %}})

## Conclusion
***Why?***
